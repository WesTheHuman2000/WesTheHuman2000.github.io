            Move all ingredients to one side of the pan and start cracking your eggs in the other,
             frying until cooked through. Serve a bed of potato and tomatoes with your egg and sausage sitting proudly on top.

        <ul>
            <li>Thickly sliced bread</li>
            <li>About 3 tbsp of butter</li>
            <li>Large Eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Put your pan on to warm up and prepare your bread by cutting out a hole in the middle and buttering both sides.
             Add the bread into the pan on a medium-low heat and press down to flatten slightly.
            Add a little butter to the pan inside the hole you created in the slice of bread. 
            Crack an egg into the hole and cook until the bottom of the bread is golden (approx. 3 minutes). 
            Flip your bread and eggs carefully and cook until the other side of the toast is golden and the egg is cooked perfectly.
            Serve with bacon, beans, condiments or any of your favourite breakfast additions.</p>
