            So you have entered the world of woodgas stoves, now you may be wondering, what is a woodgas stove?
            As <a href = "https://sectionhiker.com/how-to-choose-a-backpacking-wood-stove" target="_blank">sectionhiker.com</a> would define it, "have a two-stage burn, that generates heat by burning wood and a by-product called wood gas, 
            making them very hot and efficient, 
            while reducing all the wood you put in them to a fine ash. 
            Theyâ€™re basically double-walled cans that pipe wood gas from the inner can to the top of the outer can where it can be burned as fuel, 
            thereby producing more energy from a single wood load".
            <br>
            The neat thing about woodgas stoves as well is that you can make them yourself too, there are plenty of things online with diy of these stoves. 
            This page also gives some resources to help you get started on your woodgas stove journey.

try to find an explanation of how CO and Methane are both flammable, and both what smoke comprises of- so the idea is to convey that if you can inject hot air into the mix of CO and methane you get combustion resulting in H20. the worldstove guy lights them up INDOORS
