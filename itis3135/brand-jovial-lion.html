		<h2>Jovial Lion Enterprises Brand Page</h2>
		<p>The Jovial Lion Enterprises started off as a small sofware development company that worked as a freelance company. We wrote software for companies like Google, Apple, and even Harrist Teeter. 
			However, as time went on we have changed our business practices. We have found that selling yellow bananas was actually much more profitable and fulfilling so as a result Jovial Lion Enterprises is now
			a banana manufacturer.
		</p>
		
		<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Some amazing things about our company!</h3>

			<li>We only sell yellow bananas</li>
