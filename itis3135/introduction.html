            <li>Interesting story about myself: 
                My last name came to be from certain circumstances in my family history. Back in the Shang dynasty (towards the very end) my Ancestor Bi Gan was half brothers with the corrupt Emperor Zhou Xin (the last emperor of the Shang dynasty), Bi Gan was executed by by the Emperor for speaking out against his terrible rule. After her husband was murdered, Bi Gan's wife fled to a forest where she gave birth to a son. After Zhou Xin was taken down the new dynasty's ruler granted her and her son land with a new last name "Lin" or æž—, the character means forest in Chinese given the circumstance of the birth of Bi Gan's son in the Chang Forest
