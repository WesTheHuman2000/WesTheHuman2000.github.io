		<h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
		
        <!--This will be the first site https://www.google.com/-->
        <section>
            <heading>Website One</heading>
            <a href="https://www.google.com" style="font-size: 30px;"> Google's Home Page</a>
            <p>The well known home page of the all familiar Google. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>C - This site has very good contrast, the overall color scheme of the website is white with the main subject, the google logo and art, being anything but that. 
                    This draws attention only to the logo while also being easy on the eyes.
                    
                </li>
                <li>R - This page does not really boast all that much repetition at first glance however if you take a deeper look you notice that there is repetition in the colors and fonts. 
                    the consistency of the fonts and colors really brings that sense of uniformity out while also looking pretty professional.
                </li>
                <li>A - This page does not have a lot of content but the things that it does have are aligned. The search button and the Im feeling lucky button are on the same plane with a descryption of the current 
                    special google art aligned directly under it.
                </li>
                <li>P - This page has good proximity, the buttons of im feeling lucky and search are both related in the sense that they can bring up different web results when clicked. In the bottom left you have things like
                    advertising and business grouped together. </li>
            </ul>

        <!--This will be the second site https://arngren.net/-->
        <section>
            <heading>Website One</heading>
                <a href="https://arngren.net" style="font-size: 30px;"> Arngren's Home Page</a>
                <p>A site for buying things like vehicles</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C - This site has some real contrasts in it however I would say that there is actually TOO much contrast in it. There is soo many things going on in the page that it is overwhelming and 
                        the font sizes used are all over the place. They group larger fonts together making it harder to distinguish words from one another and when they don't do that the color contrasts of brigh colors
                        on white look awful
                    </li>
                    <li>R - To say that theres even a crumb of repetition on this site is akin to saying that the sky is purple, or that birds are not real, or even that we all live on a donut shaped pyramid. 
                        The colors of the font in this site is all over the place. Theres not even any similar font-sizes or at least if there is it is mixed up in the sea or random colored and sized fonts as to not allow 
                        you to notice it.
                    </li>
                    <li>A - The alignment of this page is horrendous, there are random boxes all over the place and just when you think that there would be any sembelance of alignment it is broken up by some random boxes for 
                        other products. 
                    </li>
                    <li>P - the proximity for this site is pretty bad. Everything is very close together without any room to show that any single item is not related to another one. Things are strewn around haphazardly
                        and it really makes you wonder how this even happened.
                    </li>
                </ul>
